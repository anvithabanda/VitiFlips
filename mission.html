                Hello, we are Niti and Veera—two individuals fueled by our passions and
                talents to create meaningful change within our community. Inspired by
                our experiences in India, we founded this organization with a vision to
                uplift underprivileged children through the transformative power of
                design.

                Since launching Viti.Flips, we have sold over 100 pieces of upcycled
                jewelry and clothing. Our creations range from re-strung necklaces and
                recycled bracelets to altered clothes, each piece reflecting our
                commitment to sustainability and creativity. Along the way, we’ve also
                built a thriving Instagram community with over 724 supporters, helping
                to spread our message and connect with like-minded individuals. In
                addition to the funds we've raised from our sales so far, we were able
                to successfuly raise $1,500 to provide winter sweaters for over 245
                underprivileged children in grades 1 through 5 at the Ramasona Pay
                Centre School in Gujarat, India.
