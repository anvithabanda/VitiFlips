            <p>Hi! I’m currently a junior in high school and co-founded Viti.Flips with Niti in December 2023, during our sophomore year. Since starting this passion project, we’ve learned so much—from navigating challenges to finding creative ways to make a difference. Personally, I’ve developed a strong passion for sustainability, especially through self-expression in jewelry and fashion.</p>
            <p>Outside of Viti.Flips, I love painting, listening to music, and spending time with friends. I plan to major in Business in college, with a focus on marketing or finance, and I’m excited to carry everything I’ve learned from Viti.Flips into my future. My hope is for this project to continue growing, inspiring others to give back, raise awareness, and embrace more sustainable lifestyles.</p>

          <p>Hi, I'm currently a junior and highschool and driven by our shared passion to make a difference and raise awareness, Veera and I launced VitiFlips in 2023. This journey has taught me so much— from networking and marketing to sustainability efforts— and it's been incredible to recently assemble a team of individuals who are eager to support our mission and create meaningful change.</p>
          <p>Beyond VitiFlips, I love playing the piano, listening to music, and spending time with friends. I plan to pursue a career in healthcare, where I hope to apply my experiences in helping others, effective communication, and making a meaningful impact. This project has been an incredible journey so far, and I'm excited for all the initiatives we have ahead.</p>

          Hi! I’m Anushka Dhar and I’m currently a junior in high school. I joined Viti.Flips because I have a deep appreciation for expression, especially when it comes to fashion, but also because I’d love to be a part of an organization that promotes sustainability in our society today while being able to offer my ideas. Outside of school, I enjoy listening to music, spending time with friends, and journaling. I plan to pursue finance in college, though I’m also interested in exploring public policy and technology. I’m super excited to be a part of everything Viti.Flips has to offer and having the opportunity to contribute!
